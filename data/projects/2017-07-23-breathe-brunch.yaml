description: Breathe Ministries are welcoming Linda Huskisson, Trustee of Hope Into Action and co-author of 'Cheating Death, Living Life,' as she shares her story; "a modern day miracle finder, a responder to the heart, voice and call of God. Her story is one of a living Saviour, who cares, who has changed her life and who has replaced her many tears with laughter, hope and joy."
